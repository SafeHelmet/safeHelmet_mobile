# SafeHelmet Mobile App

**A Cross-Platform Bluetooth Application for SafeHelmet**

This project is a Kotlin Multiplatform application designed to interact with the SafeHelmet device via Bluetooth. It leverages the power of Kotlin Multiplatform to share a significant portion of the codebase between Android and iOS, while still allowing for platform-specific implementations where necessary.
